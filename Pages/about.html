            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Bees are an insect apart of the Hymenoptera order. All bees' bodies are divided into three parts, the head, thorax, and abdomen. They all have hair and two pairs of wings. Bees are not only black and yellow, they occassionally come in colors like red, blue, or green. Bees, on average, range in size from as big as 1 inch, to as small as two milimeters.</p>

            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>Bees nests are usually in trees, logs, or rocky cliffs. There are rows of wax comb, which worker bees will store pollen and honey in these wax combs, and the queen bee will lay her eggs there. It is important for these bees to live in areas that provide nectar and pollen throughout the spring and summer. Honey bees also need a source of water within 1 mile. Bees make their own hives, however, there were some efforts to preserve the bee population and create artificial habitats for them. These artificial habitats have access to combs that are dependable and convenient to make it easier for them to survive.</p>

            <h2>Behavior</h2>
            <p>Bees are often most known for pollination. When the bee enters a flower, their goal is to either feed on nector or gather pollen. Some of the pollen will then stick to the bee's body, which is deposited on the next flower, acting as fertilization. This aids the food chain, as fruits and seeds grow, which other animals use as their food source. <a href="https://www.farmers.gov/blog/value-birds-and-bees#:~:text=Honey%20bees%20alone%20pollinate%2080,of%20many%20other%20pollinator%20species.">According to Farmers.gov, </a> "Honey bees alone pollinate 80 percent of all flowering plants, including more than 130 types of fruits and vegetables." For protection, female bees can string, but only if they feel threated they will. Honey bees are often more aggressive, because they need to protect their hive and larvae, unlike native bees.</p>
