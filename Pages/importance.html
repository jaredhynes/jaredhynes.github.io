            <h2>Benefits of Insects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bees pollinate food crops, so other animals and ourselves can eat. Without them, we may not have all of the fruit and seeds that we eat.</li>
                <li>Because bees pollinate around 80% of our flowers, we depend on them to keep the food chain up. Our ecosystem could collapse without them.</li>
                <li>Aside from pollination, bees also provide honey and jelly, which are high quality foods that we consume.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why are bees in danger?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bees suffer from habitat loss because they live in trees, which many of them are being cut down. </li>
                <li>Climate change and extreme weather is making it difficult for these animals to survive. </li>
                <li>There have been invasive speices that are not native to the land which wreck havoc on the native bees. They are also subject to new parasites and diseases which can wipe out their whole nest's population.</li>
            </ul>
